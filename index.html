    <h2 class="sectionTitle">Food I Like in New York</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class="foodList"><a href="https://somtumdernewyork.com/" target="_blank">somtum der</a></li>
      <p class="text">Somtum Der specialized in authentic, yet contemporary, Isan (Northeastern Thai)cuisine. Their Pad Ki Mao is my favorite.</p>
      <li class="foodList"><a href="https://www.kimuranyc.com/" target="_blank">Kimura</a>
      </li>
      <p class="text">Kimura is a Japanese restaurant specializing in motsunabe(a traditional japanese hotpot), a rich broth made of beef or pork intestines. If you are uncomfortable with organ meats, they also provide shabu-shabu, rice bowls, and sushi. My favorite item here is the Collage Nabe.</p>
      <li class="foodList"><a href="https://www.pocha32.com/" target="_blank">Pocha 32</a></li>
      <p class="text">POCHA means a vendor in a street or other public places that serves Korean comfort food or market food. I had many happy memories here after a night out with friends. Their watermelon soju is very famous. To me, nothing beats a late night seafood jeongol.</p>
      <li class="foodList"><a href="https://miriamrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Miriam</a></li>
      <p class="text">Miriam serves uniquely, distinctly Israeli cuisine. Their menu is seasonal, and many of the ingredients come straight from Israel. As a big fan of mediterranean food, I love every dish here, but Kadaif Wrapped Shrimp and Lamb Shawarma are probably my favorite.</p>

  <h2 class="sectionTitle">About</h2>
  <div id="aboutSection">
    <p>
      I love going places and eating food.
      <br><br>
      Chinese food is obligated my favorite since I am Chinese, but I love pretty much all the asian food. Mediterranean food is probably my favorite non-asian cuisine, or maybe Mexican, I have a difficult time to decide. Luckily I live in Queens, New York, I can get authentic food from all over the world!
      <br><br>
      I wish I can have more time and money to go on more trips. There are so many places I haven't been to. My ultimate travel dream is to go to Kenya and see the animal migration with my own eyes.
      <br><br>
      Anyway, this page has some of my happy places and I would like to share with you all. Hope you like it!
